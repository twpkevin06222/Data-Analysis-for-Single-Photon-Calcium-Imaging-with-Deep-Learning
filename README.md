# Data-Analysis-for-Single-Photon-Calcium-Imaging-with-Deep-Learning
Affliated with Leibniz Institute for Neurobiology(LIN) Magdeburg and OVGU Magdeburg, we implemented data analysis for single photon calcium imaging with deep learning. This repo consisted of the work for deep learning team project under the guidance of Prof. Sebastian Stober from [AI Lab](https://ai.ovgu.de/), Faculty of Computer Science and Dr. Michael Lippert from [LIN](https://www.neuroscience-magdeburg.de/research/professor-jazz/michael-lippert/).
